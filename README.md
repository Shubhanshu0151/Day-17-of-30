# Day 17 of 30:
### Today, I focused on implementing themes, including dark themes and system themes, in Flutter. Understanding how to create and apply themes allowed me to ensure a consistent look and feel across the entire application. I learned how to switch between light and dark themes, enhancing the app's usability in different lighting conditions. Additionally, I explored system themes to adapt the app's appearance based on the user's device settings. These skills are essential for creating modern, user-friendly applications that respect user preferences and provide a better overall experience.

Stay tuned for more updates on my journey! ðŸš€ðŸ“±
